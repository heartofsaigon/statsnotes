## Introduction 

**_Gun Violence as a Public Health Crisis_**

:::{.column width="50%"}

- In 2018, the U.S. saw over 39,000 gun-related deaths.
- Gun violence is now the leading cause of death for children and teens.
- Community shootings often occur in spatial clusters, not in isolation.

**_Unequal Burden Across States_**

- States differ widely in gun laws, social conditions, and urbanization.
- These differences result in substantial variation in shooting rates.
- Some regions experience persistently elevated risks, even when adjusting for population size.

## Introduction

- Our goal is to uncover geographic patterns and influential predictors of shooting incidents across U.S. states in 2018.

**_Why It Matters_**

- Helps guide state-level policy interventions.
- Equips public health leaders with data for resource targeting.
- Supports equity-driven violence prevention strategies.


## Data extraction and exploration

Data include shooting counts and population in 49 states, extracted from [gunviolencearchive.org](gunviolencearchive.org){preview-link="true"}.

Covariates were extracted from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/) and other sites. We searched for state-level covariates that potentially impact shooting incident in the literature. 

- *Demographic Variables:* median age, urbanization percentage.
- *Socioeconomic variables:* percentage of bachelor/higher degree, poverty, unemployment, income, drug use.
- *Gun related-variables:* gun policy score. 

We also considered *gun ownership* and *alcohol consuming* but they are highly correlated with gun policy and drug use, respectively.   

## Data extraction and exploration

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 6
a<-
  select(dat, -state, -case, -population, -E, -sir)|>
  cor()

colnames(a)<- rownames(a)<- c("Gun policy", "Age", "Bac/higher degree", "Unemployment", "Urban", "Drug use", "Poverty", "Income")

corrplot(a, method = "number")
#ggpairs(a)
```

- Remove `income` due to its high correlation with `Bachelor/higher degree` and `Gun policy`.
- Fit Poisson regression with independent residuals using spike-and-slab priors to evaluate the contributions of `gun policy` and `Bachelor/higher degree`.   

## Data extraction and exploration

We use standardized incidence ratio (SIR) as the population size vary across states. 

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
state_data<-
select(dat, state, population)|>
  arrange(desc(population))

# Create the bar plot
ggplot(state_data, aes(x = reorder(state, -population), y = population)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Population by State (49 regions)",
       x = "State",
       y = "Population") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Data extraction and exploration

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-height: 3.8

mapview(joint_mydat, zcol = "sir", color = "gray", alpha.regions = 0.8,
        map.types = "CartoDB.Positron" ,
        legend.args = list(title = "SIR"))

# ggplot(joint_mydat) +
#   geom_sf(aes(fill = sir), color = "black") +
#   scale_fill_gradientn(colors = c("white", "palevioletred1" , "palevioletred2",
#                                   "palevioletred3" , "palevioletred4")) +
#   labs(title = "Shooting Cases in U.S. States in 2018",
#        fill = "SIR") +
#   xlab("longitude")+
#   ylab("latitude")+
#   theme_minimal()

```

- The map shows that several adjacent states share similarly high or low SIR values.
- These clusters indicate a potential spatial structure—regions with higher-than-expected shooting rates are often neighbouring each other.
- $\mathrm{SIR} > 1$ indicates the observed cases are higher than expected from the standard population.

## Data extraction and exploration

We obtain global and local Moran test to evaluate the spatial structure. 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
Global test:

```{r}
queen_nb <- poly2nb(joint_mydat, queen = TRUE)

queen_weights <- nb2listw(queen_nb, style = "B")
gmoran = moran.test(joint_mydat$sir, listw = queen_weights)
tibble(Measure = c("statistic", "estimate", "p.value"), 
       Value = c(gmoran$estimate[1:2], gmoran$p.value))|>
  kable(digits = 2)
```

Local test:

joint_mydat<- cbind(joint_mydat,lmp =  lmoran[,"Pr(z > E(Ii))"])

# mapview(states_map, zcol = "p.value", color = "gray",
#         map.types = "CartoDB.Positron", col.regions = c("blue", "red"))

ggplot(joint_mydat) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = lmp>0.05)) +

Global and local Moran tests indicate slight spatial autocorrelation, suggesting the need for modelling shooting incident to better reveal and adjust for local spatial dependencies and covariate effects.

## Statistical methods - variable selection 

- We fit the Poisson regression using Spike-and-Slab priors.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&y_{i} \sim Pois(E_i\gamma_i)\\
&\ln\gamma_i = \beta_0 + \boldsymbol{x}'_i\boldsymbol{\beta}_1 +\theta_{i}
\end{aligned}
$$
**Prior distributions:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\beta_0 \sim N(0,5);\quad \beta_{1j} \sim  \delta N(0,5) +  (1-\delta)N(0,0.001)\quad \\
&\theta_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2),\quad 1/\sigma^2 \sim \mathrm{Gam}(1, 0.0260), \quad \delta \sim U(0,1)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Statistical methods - variable selection 

```{r}
#| fig-align: center
name = c(
  "Gun policy", "Age", "Poverty", "Unemployment",
  "bachelor/higher degree", "Urban", "Drug use" 
)

r_ind = read_rds("../03_result/ind.rds")
r_ind$draws("inc_ind", format = "matrix")|>
  apply(2, mean)|>
  `names<-`(name)|>
  {\(i) tibble(variable = names(i), percent = i*100) }()|>
  arrange((percent))|>
  mutate(variable = factor(variable, levels = variable))|>
  ggplot(aes(x= variable, y = percent))+
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")+
  ylab('inclusion percentage')+
  coord_flip()+
   theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

- We remove `bachelor/higher degree` due to its strong correlation with `gun policy` and minimal contribution to the outcome.
- `age` is also eliminated for its weak contribution.


## Statistical methods - models

We fit three models: CAR, BYM and BYM 2 and compare model fitting using WAIC.

**BYM 2 model:**

$$
\begin{aligned}
&Y_i \sim Pois(E_i\gamma_i); \quad \ln\gamma_i = \beta_0 + \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol\beta_1 + \boldsymbol b_i,\\
&\boldsymbol b_i = \sigma(\sqrt{1-\rho}\theta_i + \sqrt\rho\phi_i^*)
\end{aligned}
$$

**BYM model:**

$$
\ln\gamma_i = \beta_0 + \boldsymbol{x}_i'\boldsymbol\beta_1 + \theta_i + \phi_i
$$

- models assume an additive linear relationship between covariates and the log-risk.
- Also, spatial variation and unstructured noise both exist and are additive.

## Statistical methods - models

**Prior distributions (BYM 2)** 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\beta_0 \sim N(0,5);\quad \beta_{1j} \sim N(0,5); \quad \theta \sim N(0,1) \\
&\sigma \sim N^+(0,1), \quad \rho \sim Beta(.5, .5)
\end{aligned}
$$
and $\phi_i$ is the spatial random effect modelled with intrinsic conditional autoregressive model (CAR) that smooths the data according to a certain neighbourhood structure, 

**Prior distributions (BYM)** 

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\beta_0 \sim N(0,5);\quad \beta_{1j} \sim N(0,5); \\
&\theta \sim N(0,\sigma^2_{\theta}); \quad 1/\sigma^2_{\theta} \sim Gam(1, 0.026)\\
&1/\sigma^2_{\phi} \sim Gam(1,1)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Model fitting 

- All models, including the variable selection model, are fitted using `stan` in the R environment. 
- `stan` employs full Bayesian inference via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. 
- We generate 2000 samples after 4000 warm-up iterations. 
- Model convergence is assessed using $\hat{R}$, with values below 1.1 indicating convergence.


## Results - WAIC of three models 

```{r}

bym2 = read_rds("../03_result/bym2.rds")
bym = read_rds("../03_result/bym.rds")
car = read_rds("../03_result/car.rds")

tibble(Model = c("CAR", "BYM", "BYM 2"), WAIC = c(421.6, 420.6, 421))|>
  kable(digits = 2)
```

From BYM 2, we have 

```{r}
bym2$summary("rho", mean, hdi)|>
  kable(digits = 2)
```

- 95% HDI of $\rho$ indicates that neighbouring regions exhibit similarity in their outcomes, meaning that spatial clustering is indeed a real feature of the data. 
- We select BYM 2 as the primary model, as its WAIC is slightly higher than that of BYM  

## Results - Associated predictors 

```{r}
#| fig-align: center

d.pre<-
bym2$summary("beta", mean = ~mean(exp(.)), ~hdi(exp(.)))|>
  mutate(variable = c("gun ownership",  "poverty", "unemployment", "urban", "drug use"))

# Reorder for plotting (top to bottom)
d.pre<- mutate(d.pre, variable = factor(variable, levels = rev(variable)))

# Plot
ggplot(d.pre, aes(x = mean, y = variable)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = lower, xmax = upper), height = 0.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray50") +
  labs(
    x = "Posterior Mean (95% CrI)",
    y = NULL,
    title = "Forest Plot of Posterior Estimates"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)
```

- We found evidence that as drug use increases by 1%, the RR increases by 8%, assuming all other covariates are held constant. This is supported by the 95% HDI [1.01, 1.15].  
- Although the effect of urbanization is not evident, as indicated by the 95% HDI [0.98, 1], urbanization may have a harmful association with shooting incidents; further investigation is required to confirm this evidence.

## Relative risk of shooting incidents by state

We evaluate the risk of shooting incident relative to the expected baseline. 

```{r}
joint_mydat<- cbind(joint_mydat, bym2$summary("rr", mean, hdi)[,-1])|>
  rename("RR" = mean, "SIR" = sir)

mapview(joint_mydat, zcol = "RR", color = "gray",
highlight = leaflet::highlightOptions(weight = 4),
popup = leafpop::popupTable(dplyr::mutate_if(joint_mydat, is.numeric,
                                              round, digits = 2),
zcol = c("ID", "case", "SIR", "RR", "lower", "upper"),
row.numbers = FALSE, feature.id = FALSE))
```

## Relative risk of shooting incidents by state 

```{r}

rr<-
bym2$summary("rr", mean, hdi)|>
  mutate(variable = dat$state)|>
  mutate(`High RR` = ifelse(lower >1, "evident", "Not evident") )

ggplot(rr, aes(x = reorder(variable, mean), y = mean, color = `High RR`)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), width = 0.2) +
  # Reference line at RR=1
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = 2, color = "gray40") +
  coord_flip() +
  # A minimal theme often looks nice for forest plots
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Relative Risk (RR) of Shooting Incidents by State",
       x = "State",
       y = "RR (95% HDI)",
       color = "High RR") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("evident" = "red", "Not evident" = "black"))
```

## Exceedance probabilities

We calculate the probabilities of relative risk being greater than $1.5$.


```{r}
exc<-
bym2$draws("rr", format = "matrix")|>
  `colnames<-`(dat$state)|>
  apply(2, \(i) i>1.5)|>
  apply(2, mean)

joint_mydat = cbind(joint_mydat, exc = exc)

mapview(joint_mydat, zcol = "exc", color = "gray",
        popup = leafpop::popupTable(dplyr::mutate_if(joint_mydat, is.numeric,
                                              round, digits = 2),
zcol = c("ID", "case", "SIR", "RR", "lower", "upper"),
row.numbers = FALSE, feature.id = FALSE)
        )
```


## Conclusion

- Evidence links drug use to shooting incidents.  
- New York has the lowest rate of shootings, while the District of Columbia has the highest.  
- Out of 49 states, 20 have rates exceeding expected baselines.  
- Alabama, Delaware, District of Columbia, Louisiana, and Mississippi exceed baselines by over 50% with a probability of 1.  
- Future studies should consider temporal effects, which allow for describing temporal changes over years.
